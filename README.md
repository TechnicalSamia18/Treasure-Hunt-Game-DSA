# Treasure-Hunt-Game-DSA
The Treasure Hunt Game is a DSA-based project where players navigate through connected locations represented as a graph. Using hints and limited moves, they search for hidden treasure. The game also displays the shortest path to treasure locations, testing logical thinking and graph traversal concepts.
